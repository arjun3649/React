//useEffect Example:
//Imagine you have a magical notebook (React), and you want it to remind you
//to do your homework whenever your friend tells you a new joke
//(let's call it "counter"). useEffect is like a note in your magical
//notebook that says, "If your friend tells you a new joke, remind
//yourself to do homework." So, every time your friend shares a
//joke, your magical notebook reminds you about homework.

//useCallback Example:
//Now, let's say you have a favorite person (Callback) who's really good at telling jokes.
// Whenever you want to hear a joke, you always ask this specific person.
//useCallback is like a note in your
//magical notebook that says, "When you want to hear a joke, always ask your favorite person Callback."
//This ensures that you consistently go to the same person for jokes,
//not randomly to different people.

//In simpler terms, useEffect helps you remember to do something when a
//specific event happens, like getting a reminder in your magical notebook.
//On the other hand, useCallback helps you remember to always go to the same person
//for a particular task, like asking your favorite person for jokes.

  //useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
  //Itâ€™s similar to memoization in JavaScript but with more built-in support for React.
  // it remembers the previous state of function and update accordingly.
  // in simple terms this hook is used to store everythihng in cache and memorize the state ,
  //this hook is generally used for optimisation.

  // useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.
  // It can be used to perform side effects like data fetching or setting up event handlers.

  // in dependecies it will run again
